            <h3>This is Benevolent they are a purple and green dragon with read horns and spines. I created them out of my interest in dragons and a desire to have my very own dragon character. I drew them with their tongue out because I wanted to make them look cute and non-threatening although they are very capable of defending themselves and especially their close friends.</h3>

            <img src="images/peril.JPG" width="400">
            <h3>This is Peril. She is my favorite character from the "Wings of Fire" book series. She first appeared in the first book and has been my favorite ever since. I based this drawing off of her design off of the cover of the 8th book and while I am not entirely proud of the coloring I am slightly impressed how I drew her neck. </h3>
