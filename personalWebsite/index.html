            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <h3>My name is Jordan Santiago, I was born in Queens, New York on April 12th 2004. After my birth my parents
                separated in a shared custody agreement. My brother was born from another father in 2007. Ever since I have been 
                for the most part I lived with my mother and brother on during the week and visited my father and step-mother on the 
                weekends. I met my best friend across the street from my father at the age of 4 and we have been friends ever since. 
                I first attended PS.71 for kindergarden and 1ST grade, but left due to bullying and custody issues. For the rest of my public school
                years I attended PS.108 and graduated, during that time my class took the hour of code project and I had been the only one to have completed it. 
                That accomplishment made we feel special and talented. By then I had gotten an interest in the STEM classes and wanted to become an
                enginner. In 2015 I had been diagnosed with autism and would need a para to help me stay focused during my middle school years.
                I attended MS.137 for middle school and during my 6th and 7th grade summers I attended the BEAM (Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics)
                program who have since guided me in my mathematical learning and reccomended other STEM related programs and high schools with 
                available college and AP clases. I graduated middle school in 2018 and during my middle school years I had gained an interest in art and animation
                as well as gaming. I would attend my first 2 years of highschool at Medgar Evers College Prepatory Scholol (MECPS) which had been reccomended
                to me by BEAM. After my first year it was decided that I no longer had any need for a para. I took my first AP classes in 10th grade and attended computer science which would 
                teach me about Javascript and would set the first few stones in my coding travel. Halfway though the year my teacher reccomended All Star Code to me as a means to continue
                my computer science education. Intrigued I entered an application, and that acceptance email made feel great joy and leads me right to today, a proud student of ASC.
